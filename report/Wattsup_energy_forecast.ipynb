    "There is a well-known relationship between electricity demand and temperature in the electricity industry, most commercial power suppliers use temperature to forecast energy demand. More and more Australian homes are considering adding solar panels as a source of renewable energy, the team is interested in whether adding solar power as another variable will improve the accuracy of the model that is currently being used. By using convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, we improved the accuracy of the energy forecasting by implementing the solar power output dataset along with the temperature dataset that were originally used. Using temperature and solar power datasets from 2017 to 2021, the team concluded that both CNN and LSTM modelling techniques provided more accurate energy forecasting and comparing both models, LSTM is the superior model over CNN. The findings from this experiment suggested that energy providers should consider implementing datasets from various renewable sources to improve its modelling accuracy in order to improve energy pricing and reduce wastage.  \n"
